This is an early version of a library to access [Github API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/) written in [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin) using [coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html).

There is still lots of stuff missing. Currently supported:

- Search
  - Issues ([example](https://github.com/plastic-karma/githubapikt/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/plastickarma/githubapikt/examples/SearchExamples.kt#L14))
